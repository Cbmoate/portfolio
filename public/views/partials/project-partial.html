        <h5>This is Chaser, a project I was a part of while I was at the Rutgers Bootcamp.  The purpose was to help users find limited release and seasonal beers and keep track of their release dates.  We used the breweryDB API to help build this basic proof of concept version.  The project is no longer hosted, but feel free to look over our code on Github </h5>

        <h5>Splash'd was an app attempting to solve a very common problem:  the need to find a bathroom.  We used an open source mapping API to find locations that would likely have public restrooms available, and then populated the map with those locations for the user.</h5>
