		<h2>Career History</h2>

			<p>I've spent the last 12 years working in restaurants and kitchens.  I've done everything from washing dishes to help act as part of the opening management team to brand new restaurants.  That was pretty cool, but I couldn't help feeling like I had just made a mistake when I was 18 and stuck with it for over a decade.  So after a seasonal layoff I decided to change tracks and get see if I could hack it as a developer.</p>

		<h2>Education</h2>

			<p>School of hard knocks.  Also Brookdale Culinary Education Center and Rutgers Univeristy</p>

		<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
			
			<p>When I'm not stuck at a computer or banging my head against a wall I'm usually at the kitchen table playing games (Magic: the Gathering and Fluxx are my favorites) or standing around in the craft beer section of the liquor store trying to figure out what barrel-aged imperial chocolate porter I'm going to try next.  That, or watching QVC with my wife.</p>
